Nicolas Paul's Tap
------------------

Some formulaes which are not available inside Homebrew's core [0] but
are still used by Nicolas Paul [1].


How do I install these formulae?
--------------------------------

First install the tap locally:

    brew tap nc0fr/nc0

Then you can install any formulae using `brew install`:

    brew install nc0fr/nc0/<formula>


Documentation
-------------

Read both `brew help` and the online Homebrew's documentation [2] for
information about Homebrew and external taps.
